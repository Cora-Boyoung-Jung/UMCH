## Differences in caregiver contingent talk during infancy 

- Does talking to an infant about his or her actions affect his or her early language development?
- Is the impact the same for higher and lower income households? 

## Best Figure
- Figure 2 told us that the lower the socioeconomic status is the less expressive vocabulary they have. The higher socioeconomic status is the more expressive vocabulary they have. When a child becomes 15 months old is when their vocabulary will either greatly expand or slightly increase. 
- Design features that were really good in this figure were the control and intervention lines. You could see the results clearly and how they compared.

- Model type- Linear Regression
- Fixed effects predictors - Age (months), CareGiver speech
- Interaction - age + intervention 
- Random effects - participant

## Modeling Process Checklist

Which of the following items are described and presented in the paper? You can ~~cross out~~ words by surrounding them with double tildes -- so cross out things you can't find.

- Model planning
- Plots of the data
- Coefficients, model summary information
- Model assessment (condition checking)
- Results of hypothesis testing or model selection
- Model interpretation - what results mean
- Prediction plots
