## 1. Project Partner
Our project partner is the United Methodist Community House and Michelle A. Cossar is a director of Child Programs there. The main mission of United Methodist Community House is "Increasing the ability of children, youth, adults, and families to succeed in a diverse community." This organization existed since 1902 and with the heart to serve a diverse population, they are thriving to meet the needs and offering opportunities to children, youth, adults, seniors, and families. Their core values includes faith, love, integrity, teamwork, and excellence. 

## 2. Goals and Deliverables
Questions to answer:  
- Which domain in the area of development is scored the lowest for each age group?  
- Which domain in the area of development is scored the highest for each age group?  
- Which domain in the area of development is scored the highest and the lowest overall?  
- Do Age and Gender have effect on Brigrance test result of a child?     
  

Audience:  
Our audience is Michelle A. Cossar (our project partner) and the other teachers at UMCH. Our goal is to develop some useful graphics and meaningful conclusions all to provide actionable information for our project partner.   

Materials to produce:  
- Excel file of the data  
- The report in pdf with graphics, tables, and statistical model conclusions  


## 3. Data
Michelle is collecting data at the moment. She has teachers doing testing on the students recently. We do not have it yet, but are hoping to have it by the latest at Friday September 16th. Michelle is collecting hard copy of the tests which she will scan and email to us along with any other information we need with the children's names whited out. We will then tidy up the data and make an excel spreadsheet file for our analysis.


## 4. Data Prep
We will need to put data into spreadsheet that can then be put into r. Our data currently consists of 30 pages of scanned evaluations- one for each child. We will need to first transcribe the data from the pdf forms into an excel file. From there, we can export the file as csv before importing that into R.

## 7. Work plan
We are planning to divide the work and hold meetings regularly if anything comes up or reporting progress. I think we will meet mostly to report rather than work together but both are possible options. Tuesdays after 4:30 are the best option for us to meet together outside of class besides the weekend.
