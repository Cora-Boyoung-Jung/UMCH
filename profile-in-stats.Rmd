<!-- Note: the out.height R chunk option sets the height of the rendered figure as a fraction of the slide. You can adjust it to resize the figure to a size that works for you. (Yes, there's an out.width too, but if you set only one, the aspect ratio of the figure will not get messed up!) -->


## Contribution to Statistics

Lee has made major contributions to the Stats and Data Science community. She as 25 peer-reviewed papers on multivariate analysis and statistical learning. She's also known for her research on support vector machines which helped to bridge the gap between statistics and computer science.

- Bright Side
  - Yoonkyung Lee has taken the knowledge she has learned and has shared it and passed it down to the next generation. 
  - She has several current and former PhD students
  - She is a professor at a nearby University and translating her knowledge between statistics, computer science, and engineering
- Not-so-bright Side
  - Low social media presence
